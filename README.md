# RustyAlly

[ActionAlly](http://actionally.com/) is a very cool mac app that helps improve
your productivity, but it does not provide all the features I wanted out of the
box. So, this is a set of programs that help with controlling ActionAlly more
easily and from the terminal, as a bonus.

At some point this might be transformed into a proper CLI.

## Getting Started

```
cargo install rusty_ally
aa_rescheduler
```
