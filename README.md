# RustyAlly

[ActionAlly](http://actionally.com/) is a very cool mac app that helps improve
your productivity, but it does not provide all the features I wanted out of the
box. So, this is a CLI that helps with controlling ActionAlly more easily and
from the terminal, as a bonus.

## Getting Started

```
cargo install rusty_ally
rally help
```
